In this paper, we will analyze a dataset on the diagnosis of breast cancer. In the project,
we will consider which factors available in the dataset, well describe the types of cancer:
malignant and benign.
As a result, we would like to create a model that classifies types of cancer effectively.

In this paper, we will focus on identifying natural groups or clusters in patient data that
may reflect different breast cancer subtypes or other relevant patterns. By using clustering
algorithms, we will try to distinguish groups of patients with similar characteristics, which
may contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneity of this disease and to adapt
treatment strategies.
